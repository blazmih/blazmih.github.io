        My favorite hobby is drawing.  I always enjoyed drawing when I have free time. I started drawing at a young age. The first time I 've decided to draw, I couldn’t resist from not owning a few pencils and notebooks.  I was so intrigued from the connection and satisfaction I felt when I first ran the pencil in that notebook, I believe it will always be a part of me.
